StopLights
==========
C# project that models the behaviour of the intersection at 300 N 900 E in Provo, UT. If a light other than the current light is selected, the program runs a stopwatch that counts to five. If the program arrives at five without a car passing through a green light, it will either transition to the next light or back to the default light if no lights are queued. If a car does pass through a green light, the stopwatch will run for a full 30 seconds before transitioning.
